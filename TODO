Make it so that the dialog window for trials doesn't prevent from editing the parent window (when marking a mouse by checking the checkbox, the user might want to wrtie in "other" what this is about)
Make each modification in the Run (trial time etc.) as individual post / put requests and not one big request with all the data.
You may want trial_nb increment between runs (basically the first run would have trial numbers 1, 2, 3 and then a new run would start at 4. This is done in the excel export but not in the app). Check that it is an int.
Move utility fns from server to another file (cleaner).
